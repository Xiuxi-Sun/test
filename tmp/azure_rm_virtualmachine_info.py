                      Specifies the version of the platform image or marketplace
                      image used to create the virtual machine. The allowed

                      and Build are decimal numbers. Specify 'latest' to use the
                      latest version of an image available at deploy time. Even
                      if you use 'latest', the VM image will not automatically
                      update after deploy time even if a new version becomes
                      available.
