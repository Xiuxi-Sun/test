            has completed. This helps avoid premature or accidental repairs. The
            time duration should be specified in ISO 8601 format. The minimum
            allowed grace period is 30 minutes (PT30M), which is also the

            The flag that enables or disables a capability to have one or more
            managed data disks with UltraSSD_LRS storage account type on the VM
            or VMSS. Managed disks with storage account type UltraSSD_LRS can be
            added to a virtual machine or virtual machine scale set only if this
            property is enabled.

            if it is a zonal scale set. Then, it will be balanced across Fault
            Domains as far as possible. Within each Fault Domain, the virtual
            machines chosen for removal will be the newest ones that are not
            protected from scale-in. :code:`<br>`:code:`<br>` **OldestVM** When
            a virtual machine scale set is being scaled-in, the oldest virtual
            machines that are not protected from scale-in will be chosen for
            removal. For zonal virtual machine scale sets, the scale set will
            first be balanced across zones. Within each zone, the oldest virtual
            machines that are not protected will be chosen for removal.
            :code:`<br>`:code:`<br>` **NewestVM** When a virtual machine scale

          **Default** When a virtual machine scale set is scaled in, the scale
          set will first be balanced across zones if it is a zonal scale set.
          Then, it will be balanced across Fault Domains as far as possible.
          Within each Fault Domain, the virtual machines chosen for removal will
          be the newest ones that are not protected from scale-in.

          is being scaled-in, the oldest virtual machines that are not protected
          from scale-in will be chosen for removal. For zonal virtual machine
          scale sets, the scale set will first be balanced across zones. Within
          each zone, the oldest virtual machines that are not protected will be
